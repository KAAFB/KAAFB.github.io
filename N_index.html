 <p style="text-align: justify;"> In this project IT-cybersecurity team had assignment to defend the Akwaaba (Apache) server and to make the entire system (Maria Database and VM Virtual Machine)
 more secure. In the first part of the project our team created an internet security policy for Akwaaba. This was crucial because this represents the foundation of a good security system.
 All other parts of the project were implemented successfully because of our well-defined security policy. For every part of our project, we created a Milestone report, Power Point slides 
 and Weekly Log report <br/>and in them explained the project progress in detail.</p>
<p>Second part of this project was about research and finding the most effective way to protect entire Akwaaba system. As a result of this we did an excellent job with securing the server and this will
 be tested in the next part of the project by the blue team. The main part of the project segment was implementation of security programs on our Apache server. We have implemented some changes to Maria
 Database and VM to make them more secure as a system. In this segment we created a project website and updated the website with accomplishments<br/> from projectâ€™s Milestone 1.   </p>
<p>The next segment of the project includes research of vulnerability tools that our team could use to get into another team server and putting vulnerability testing into action. The other part of 
this section was documenting the findings from another team attack on our system. At the same time, we kept our project website up to date with project progress. </p>
<p>The last part of the report will be the final report (comprehensive recorder presentation) that will have all parts summarized and presented to an IT Department team for the final evaluation  
of our project. Here we will introduce our team and the project- objectives, backgrounds <br/>and relative technologies and concept that we were using. One big part of this project segment would be  
our team experience and project management experience as well.   </p>
